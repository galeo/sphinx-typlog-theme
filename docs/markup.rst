Quote
~~~~~

Here is an example on block quote:

    | Beautiful is better than ugly.
    | Explicit is better than implicit.
    | Simple is better than complex.
    | Complex is better than complicated.
    | Flat is better than nested.
    | Sparse is better than dense.
    | Readability counts.
    | Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    | Although practicality beats purity.
    | Errors should never pass silently.
    | Unless explicitly silenced.
    | In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    | There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    | Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    | Now is better than never.
    | Although never is often better than *right* now.
    | If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    | If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    | Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

List
~~~~

* Make a list, and its items

  1. Ordered item: foo

     a. A third level item

  2. Ordered item: bar

* The second item has no items
* The third item has unordered items

  * A foo is a foo
  * A bar is a bar


Options Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-a            command-line option "a"
-b file       options can have arguments
              and long descriptions
--long        options can be long also
--input=file  long options can also have
              arguments
/V            DOS/VMS-style options too

Inline Style
------------

A plain text mixed with **bold** and *italic*. And we have ``code`` too.

Let's try a link https://lepture.com.

Footnotes
~~~~~~~~~

Plain text	Typical result
Footnote references, like [5]_.
Note that footnotes may get
rearranged, e.g., to the bottom of
the "page".

Autonumbered footnotes are
possible, like using [#]_ and [#]_.

They may be assigned 'autonumber
labels' - for instance,
[#fourth]_ and [#third]_.

.. [5] A numerical footnote. Note
   there's no colon after the ``]``.
.. [#] This is the first one.
.. [#] This is the second one.
.. [#third] a.k.a. third_
.. [#fourth] a.k.a. fourth_

Citations
~~~~~~~~~

Citation references, like [CIT2002]_.
Note that citations may get
rearranged, e.g., to the bottom of
the "page".

.. [CIT2002] A citation
   (as often used in journals).
